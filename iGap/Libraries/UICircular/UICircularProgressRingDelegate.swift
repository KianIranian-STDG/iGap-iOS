 This is the protocol declaration for the UICircularRing delegate property

 When progress is done updating via UICircularRing.setValue(_:), the
 finishedUpdatingProgress(forRing: UICircularRing) will be called.
 
 The ring will be passed to the delegate in order to keep 
 track of multiple ring updates if needed.

     This is a very hot method and may be called hundreds of times per second during animations. As such make sure to only
     do very simple and non-intensive work in this method. Doing any work that takes time will considerably slow down your application.
